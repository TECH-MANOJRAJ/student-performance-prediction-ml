# student-performance-prediction-ml
Machine Learning project that predicts student performance using Random Forest based on study hours, attendance, assignments, and parental support.
🎓 Student Performance Prediction (Machine Learning)

This project predicts whether a student will pass or fail based on key academic and behavioral features:

📚 Hours studied

📆 Attendance percentage

📝 Assignments submitted

👨‍👩‍👦 Parental support level

The model is built using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and Random Forest Classifier.
